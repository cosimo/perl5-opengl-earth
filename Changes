Changes history for OpenGL-Earth

  0.05   2014-01-26

         Removed hard dependency on Linux::Input::Wiimote.
         If you want Wiimote support, you can install it on your own.
         L::I::W doesn't build out of the box, so CPAN install of OpenGL::Earth
         would fail miserably. [RT#79833]

         Just found some time to package this experiment
         as a CPAN distribution. Will improve over time, I hope.
