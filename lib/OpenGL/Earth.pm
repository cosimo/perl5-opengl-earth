OpenGL::Earth

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Mmh... I don't think you can use this module directly.
Better look at the C<bin> folder.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It's an attempt to write an OpenGL Perl program that can display
a fancy rotating planet, while also displaying useful
geographic information on it.

The development is in a really really early stage now (Jan 2009).
Don't expect miracles.

It's basically a 10-years old OpenGL C program, translated
to Perl like 8 years ago, and then butchered and reassembled
by yours truly during some nightly hacking sessions.

The Earth texture that comes with this distribution is a stripped
down version (1024x512) of the original hi-res (4096x2048) I
downloaded from Celestia Motherlode, if I remember correctly.

If you want to use the higher resolution texture, either find
it yourself, or write me, or generate one by yourself with the
C<bin/build_texture.pl> utility I wrote.
You will need the mighty C<Imager> module for that.
