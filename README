NAME
    OpenGL::Earth

SYNOPSIS
    Mmh... I don't think you can use this module directly. Better look at
    the "bin" folder.

DESCRIPTION
    It's an attempt to write an OpenGL Perl program that can display a fancy
    rotating planet, while also displaying useful geographic information on
    it.

    The development is in a really really early stage now (Jan 2009). Don't
    expect miracles.

    It's basically a 10-years old OpenGL C program, translated to Perl like
    8 years ago, and then butchered and reassembled by yours truly during
    some nightly hacking sessions.

    The Earth texture that comes with this distribution is a stripped down
    version (1024x512) of the original hi-res (4096x2048) I downloaded from
    Celestia Motherlode, if I remember correctly.

    If you want to use the higher resolution texture, either find it yourself,
    or write me, or generate one by yourself with the bin/build_texture.pl
    utility I wrote. You will need the mighty Imager module for that.
